ECE-GY 6483 Real Time Embedded Systems || Project || Fall 2023 <br />
New York University (NYU) Tandon School of Engineering <br /> <br />

## Description
Pioneered a Wearable Gyro Speedometer using STM32F429I Discovery Board, achieving real-time linear velocity from angular velocity, sampling data every 0.5s to measure forward distance travelled. <br />
Achieved a high accuracy level with error of Â±1%, demonstrating precision of robust embedded system design. <br />
