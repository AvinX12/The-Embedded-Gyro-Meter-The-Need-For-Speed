# The-Embedded-Gyro-Meter-The-Need-For-Speed
ECE-GY 6483 Real Time Embedded Systems || Project || Fall 2023 <br />
New York University (NYU) | Tandon School of Engineering | Brooklyn, NY, USA <br /> <br />

## Description
Pioneered a Wearable Gyro Speedometer using STM32F429I Discovery Board, achieving real-time linear velocity from angular velocity, sampling data every 0.5s to measure forward distance travelled using just gyroscope. <br /> <br />
Achieved a high accuracy level with error of Â±1%, demonstrating precision of robust embedded system design. <br />

## How To Duplicate This Project?
1. Just download this repository <br />
2. Set PlatformIO work environment folder as this project's root folder <br />
3. Build the project, if no issues, upload the code to the board. [Note: board used STMicroelectronics STM32F429I-DISC1] <br />
4. Board must be attached up-right to the side of the lower part of leg (as low as possible). <br />
5. Go through the [video presentation]() from the [documents]() folder for better understanding.

<br /> For more info about the board and project, please visit [documents]() folder. <br />
Feel free to contact about the project. If so, send an email to dk4852@nyu.edu! <br />
